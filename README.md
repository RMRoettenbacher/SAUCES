# SAUCES

Stellar Activity for Understanding and Characterizing Exoplanetary Systems

For applications of this code see:
Roettenbacher & Vida (2018; https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.04762.pdf)

These codes provide a way to investigate stellar activity, and they are currently written in IDL.

Included (so far!) 

* SAUCES_period_find_FFT.pro:  IDL process for finding the most likely period of a light curve and for identifying if a light curve is likely showing evolving spots or something more stable (e.g., eclipsing binaries or pulsations).  





Soon to be added

* IDL process for removing cotrending basis vectors

* IDL process for smoothing the light curves and finding the local minima

* IDL process for making histograms of the local minima

* IDL process for identifying gaps in the data

* IDL script for putting of these preparation processes together

* IDL process for comparing the location of starspots and the times of flares
